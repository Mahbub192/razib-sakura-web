## Verify the File Exists:

The file should be at:
```
app/patient/appointments/book/page.tsx
```

To verify:
```bash
ls -la app/patient/appointments/book/page.tsx
```

---

## If Still Not Working:

1. **Check if the route is in build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build | grep "patient/appointments/book"
   ```
   Should show: `├ ○ /patient/appointments/book`

2. **Check for TypeScript errors:**
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

3. **Hard refresh browser:**
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

4. **Check browser console:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Check Console tab for errors
   - Check Network tab for failed requests

## Route Verification:

The route `/patient/appointments/book` is confirmed to exist in the build output:
```
├ ○ /patient/appointments/book           3.33 kB        99.3 kB
```

This means the file is correct, you just need to restart the dev server.
